# Clustering-and-Classifying-Olissipo

## Project Overview

In this project, I tackle the classic Olivetti faces dataset, engaging in clustering, classifying, and semi-supervised classifying. The project involves several key components:

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applying clustering algorithms to group similar faces together.
- **Supervised Learning:** Training classifiers to identify faces based on labeled data.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Leveraging a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification accuracy.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Modifying a few of the faces to test anomaly detection methods.
- **Data Compression:** Reducing the dimensionality of the data and analyzing and training models on these reduced datasets.

Throughout the project, I have avoided using neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras. Instead, I optimized my results exclusively using scikit-learn.
